# NASA Search React App

This project is a mock technical test. The purpose of this technical test is to build a React web application that provides an interface for users to search for images based on a query relating to space, using the NASA API endpoint for the image search.

## Technology Used For This Project

- React: Provides the User Interface
- React Testing Library: Tests the components of this application to ensure that it is running as expected
- Jest DOM Testing Library: Tests if certain features exist within the application
- Axios: Handles the requests made to the NASA API endpoint.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the folder for the app, enter `npm start` in the terminal to start the development server, which will open in the browser.
3. The app is now running! Use the image search in order to interact with the application.

## What I Would Add To The App If I Had More Time:

- More interaction with the images by adding features such as:
  - Zoom In/Out
  - Rotation
- Advanced search filters to enable users to search for images based on specific criteria such as:
  - Mission Type
  - Date
